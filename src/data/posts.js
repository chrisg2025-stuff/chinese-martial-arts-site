    title: "The Living Legacy of Kung Fu: More Than Just Fists",
    author: "Zhang Wei",
    excerpt: "From temples to city streets, Kung Fu is more than combat — it’s a way of living, thinking, and moving through the world.",
    content: `Growing up in Guangdong, Kung Fu wasn’t just something I saw in films — it was in our streets, in our temples, in how elders walked and moved. I studied Southern styles like Hung Gar, where rooted stances and explosive hand forms demand discipline and control. What I’ve learned is that Kung Fu teaches respect before technique, balance before power.`

    title: "How Tai Chi Changed My Mind Before My Body",
    author: "Li Wei",
    excerpt: "Practicing slow, graceful movements every morning gave me more than flexibility — it gave me clarity.",
    content: `As a software engineer constantly glued to screens, I stumbled into Tai Chi after a friend dragged me to a park session. The first few sessions were awkward. But soon I realized — it’s not about precision, it’s about presence. Tai Chi reconnected me with my breath, my posture, and eventually my peace. I now lead morning sessions for elders in my neighborhood.`

    title: "Efficiency Over Flash: What Wing Chun Taught Me About Confidence",
    author: "Amanda Chow",
    excerpt: "Wing Chun is direct. No spinning kicks, no shouting. Just the shortest path between you and your goal.",
    content: `I started Wing Chun after being bullied in school. At first, I was disappointed by how "boring" it looked. But after months of sticky hands (Chi Sao) drills and centerline theory, I began to understand the brilliance in its simplicity. Now I use Wing Chun not just for self-defense, but to move with assertiveness in life.`

    title: "My Journey to the Shaolin Temple: Training and Transformation",
    author: "Chen Ming",
    excerpt: "Six months at a remote Shaolin temple taught me more than ten years of city life ever did.",
    content: `I traveled to Dengfeng to train at a Shaolin school. We woke at 5 a.m., ran barefoot on stone paths, meditated with the monks, and practiced hundreds of forms. The intensity was beyond anything I expected. But the real change came not in my kicks — but in my sense of self-discipline and humility. I left physically stronger and spiritually lighter.`

    title: "Walking the Circle: My First Year Learning Baguazhang",
    author: "Xiu Fang",
    excerpt: "Baguazhang teaches you to move like wind around your opponent — flowing, turning, and never stopping.",
    content: `The first time I saw a Baguazhang demonstration, it looked like a dance — circular steps, twisting palms, a kind of spiral grace. When I began studying it, I realized how deceptive it was. It’s internal. Subtle. But incredibly powerful. After one year, I’ve developed better balance, improved my awareness, and found a way to express movement as meditation.`
